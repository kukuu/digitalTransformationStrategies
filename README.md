#  Digital Transformation and Strategic Thinking: Multi-speed IT

On-line Technical Delivery & Strategic Thinking
Businesses today consumes IT at several speeds all at once. Innovation and digital disruption require quick response, legacy systems call for deliberate care, and shifting operating models need a pace of change somewhere in between. Two speeds are no longer enough for the modern IT business organizations. Unless the Technical Leadership can master the art of delivering change at the pace demanded by each area of the business, they risk being relegated to tending legacy systems. There is a calling need to implement mult-speed IT strategy.

Multi-speed IT is achieved by bringing together a network of skills, instituting a dynamic operating model and installing flexible governance models.

##### Cloud Computing Platforms & Service Models

	Cloud Computing is a broad term that describes a broad range of services. 
	Since the Cloud is a broad collection of services, 
	organizations can choose where, when, and how they use Cloud Computing. 
	Such services are, Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and 
	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

	Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool
	 of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) 
	 that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or 
	 service provider interaction. 
	 By using these services there is the potential to reduce IT support costs by outsourcing 
	 hardware and software maintenance and support to the providers.

	 Characteristics associated with Cloud Computing services include:

		On-demand self-service. The ability for an end user to sign up and receive services without 
		the long delays that have characterized traditional IT normally using thin 
		client like the Browser.

		Broad network access. Ability to access the service via standard 
		platforms (desktop, laptop, mobile etc)

		Resource pooling. Resources are pooled across multiple customers.

		Rapid elasticity. Capability can scale to cope with demand peaks.

		Measured Service. Billing is metered and delivered as a utility service


###### Models

	SaaS (Software as a Service) applications are designed for end-users, delivered over the web.

		SaaS is a software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a vendor 
		or service provider and made available to customers over a network, typically the Internet.

		With Saas model you are provided with access to application softwares often 
		referred to as on-demand softwares. 
		You don't have to worry about the installation, setup and running of the application. 
		Service provider will do that for you. You just have to pay and use it through some client.

		Example: Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365.


	PaaS (Platform as a Service) is the set of tools and services designed to make coding and deploying 
	those applications quick and efficient over the Internet. 

		The model is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing 
		customers to develop, run, and manage web applications without the complexity of building and
		maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching 
		an app - via the browser.

		Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, 
		and Apache Stratos.


	IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), is the hardware and software that powers it all â€“ servers, 
	storage, networks, operating system. 

		IaaS provides you the computing infrastructure, physical or (quite often) virtual machines and 
		other resources like virtual-machine disk image library, block and file-based storage, firewalls,
		load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks etc. 

		Examples: Amazon EC2, Windows Azure, Rackspace, Google Compute Engine.

	Additional points to note:

		AWS(Amazon web services) is a complete suite which involves a whole bunch of useful web services. 
		Most popular are EC2 and S3 and they belong to IaaS service model.
		
		Although Hadoop is based on previous works by Google(GFS and MapReduce), it is not from Google. 
		It is an Apache project.It is just a distributed computing platform and does not fall into 
		any of these service models
		
		Windows Azure is both a PaaS and IaaS.

		Scalability

		Performance
		Hadoop MapReduce (Hadoop Map/Reduce) is a software framework for distributed processing of 
		large data sets on compute clusters of commodity hardware. It is a sub-project of the 
		Apache Hadoop project. The framework takes care of scheduling tasks, 
		monitoring them and re-executing any failed tasks. 

		Choose a particular platform based on your requirements and needs. For example, if you want to 
		have a Hadoop cluster on which you would run MapReduce jobs, you will find EC2 a perfect fit, 
		which is IaaS. On the other hand if you have some application, written in some language, 
		and you want to deploy it over the cloud,  you would choose something like Heroku, 
		which is an example of PaaS.
