#  Digital Transformation and Strategic Thinking: Multi-speed IT

##### On-line Technical Delivery & Strategic Thinking

Businesses today consumes IT at several speeds all at once. Innovation and digital disruption require quick response, legacy systems call for deliberate care, and shifting operating models need a pace of change somewhere in between. 

Two speeds are no longer enough for the modern IT business organizations. Unless the Technical Leadership can master the art of delivering change at the pace demanded by each area of the business, they risk being relegated to tending legacy systems. There is a calling need to implement mult-speed IT strategy.

Multi-speed IT is achieved by bringing together a network of skills, instituting a dynamic operating model and installing flexible governance models.

##### Cloud Computing Platforms & Service Models

	Cloud Computing is a broad term that describes a broad range of services. 
	Since the Cloud is a broad collection of services, 
	organizations can choose where, when, and how they use Cloud Computing. 
	Such services are, Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and 
	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

	Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool
	 of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) 
	 that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or 
	 service provider interaction. 
	 By using these services there is the potential to reduce IT support costs by outsourcing 
	 hardware and software maintenance and support to the providers.

	 Characteristics associated with Cloud Computing services include:

		On-demand self-service. The ability for an end user to sign up and receive services without 
		the long delays that have characterized traditional IT normally using thin 
		client like the Browser.

		Broad network access. Ability to access the service via standard 
		platforms (desktop, laptop, mobile etc)

		Resource pooling. Resources are pooled across multiple customers.

		Rapid elasticity. Capability can scale to cope with demand peaks.

		Measured Service. Billing is metered and delivered as a utility service


###### Models

	SaaS (Software as a Service) applications are designed for end-users, delivered over the web.

		SaaS is a software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a vendor 
		or service provider and made available to customers over a network, typically the Internet.

		With Saas model you are provided with access to application softwares often 
		referred to as on-demand softwares. 
		You don't have to worry about the installation, setup and running of the application. 
		Service provider will do that for you. You just have to pay and use it through some client.

		Example: Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365.


	PaaS (Platform as a Service) is the set of tools and services designed to make coding and deploying 
	those applications quick and efficient over the Internet. 

		The model is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing 
		customers to develop, run, and manage web applications without the complexity of building and
		maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching 
		an app - via the browser.

		Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, 
		and Apache Stratos.


	IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), is the hardware and software that powers it all – servers, 
	storage, networks, operating system. 

		IaaS provides you the computing infrastructure, physical or (quite often) virtual machines and 
		other resources like virtual-machine disk image library, block and file-based storage, firewalls,
		load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks etc. 

		Examples: Amazon EC2, Windows Azure, Rackspace, Google Compute Engine.

	Additional points to note:

		AWS(Amazon web services) is a complete suite which involves a whole bunch of useful web services. 
		Most popular are EC2 and S3 and they belong to IaaS service model.
		
		Although Hadoop is based on previous works by Google(GFS and MapReduce), it is not from Google. 
		It is an Apache project.It is just a distributed computing platform and does not fall into 
		any of these service models
		
		Windows Azure is both a PaaS and IaaS.

		Scalability

		Performance
		Hadoop MapReduce (Hadoop Map/Reduce) is a software framework for distributed processing of 
		large data sets on compute clusters of commodity hardware. It is a sub-project of the 
		Apache Hadoop project. The framework takes care of scheduling tasks, 
		monitoring them and re-executing any failed tasks. 

		Choose a particular platform based on your requirements and needs. For example, if you want to 
		have a Hadoop cluster on which you would run MapReduce jobs, you will find EC2 a perfect fit, 
		which is IaaS. On the other hand if you have some application, written in some language, 
		and you want to deploy it over the cloud,  you would choose something like Heroku, 
		which is an example of PaaS.


##### Developing technology based innovation/tool for limited budget?

			1. Plan the funding requirements to maintain momentum

				Investigate what external support is available, including 
				accelerators (a program designed to help startups get off the ground quickly, 
				often in exchange for equity), and incubators (similar to accelerators, 
				but usually in-house at a corporate or investor parent).

			2. Choice of Technology

				Don’t let the technology distract from the end goal of creating something 
				that benefits your users.

			4. Man power

				Find  developers who are happy to co-design with your users, is affordable, 
				and aligned with your ethos

			5. Educate people in your organisation about the innovation at the earliest stage 
			possible (startup mindset), take advantage of new technologies.

			Possible use of Agile and Blockchain platform for sharing resources and transactions. 

		

			Why Agile?

				1. Revenue 
				The iterative nature of agile development means features are delivered incrementally, enabling some
				 benefits to be realised early as the product continues to develop.

				2. Speed-to-market

				Research suggests about 80% of all market leaders were first to market. As well as the higher
				revenue from incremental delivery, agile development philosophy also supports the notion of early 
				and regular releases, and ‘perpetual beta’.

				3. Quality

				A key principle of agile development is that testing is integrated throughout the cycle, enabling regular
				 inspection of the working product as it develops. This allows the product owner to make adjustments 
				 if necessary and gives the product team early sight of any quality issues.

				4. Visibility

				Agile development principles encourage active user involvement throughout the product’s development 
				and a very cooperative collaborative approach. This provides excellent visibility for key stakeholders, 
				both of the project’s progress and of the product itself, which in turn helps to ensure that 
				expectations are effectively managed.

				5. Risk Management

				Small incremental releases made visible to the product owner and product team through its development 
				help to identify any issues early and make it easier to respond to change. The clear visibility in agile 
				development helps to ensure that any necessary decisions can be taken at the earliest possible opportunity, 
				while there’s still time to make a material difference to the outcome.

				6. Flexibility / Agility

				In traditional development projects, we write a big spec up-front and then tell business owners how expensive 
				it is to change anything, particularly as the project goes on. In fear of scope creep and a never-ending project, 
				we resist changes and put people through a change control committee to keep them to the essential minimum. 
				Agile development principles are different. In agile development, change is accepted. In fact, it’s expected. 
				Because the one thing that’s certain in life is change. Instead the timescale is fixed and requirements emerge 
				and evolve as the product is developed. Of course for this to work, it’s imperative to have an actively 
				involved stakeholder who understands this concept and makes the necessary trade-off decisions, 
				trading existing scope for new.

				7. Cost Control

				The above approach of fixed timescales and evolving requirements enables a fixed budget. 
				The scope of the product and its features are variable, rather than the cost.

				8. Business Engagement/Customer Satisfaction

				The active involvement of a user representative and/or product owner, the high visibility of the product 
				and progress, and the flexibility to change when change is needed, create much better business engagement 
				and customer satisfaction. This is an important benefit that can create much more positive 
				and enduring working relationships.

				9. Right Product

				Above all other points, the ability for agile development requirements to emerge and evolve, and the ability 
				to embrace change (with the appropriate trade-offs), the team build the right product. It’s all too common in 
				more traditional projects to deliver a “successful” project in IT terms and find that the product is not what 
				was expected, needed or hoped for. In agile development, the emphasis is absolutely on building the right product.

				10. More Enjoyable!

				The active involvement, cooperation and collaboration make agile development teams a much more 
				enjoyable place for most people. Instead of big specs, we discuss requirements in workshops. 
				Instead of lengthy status reports, we collaborate around a task-board discussing progress. 
				Instead of long project plans and change management committees, we discuss what’s right for the product
				 and project and the team is empowered to make decisions. In my experience this makes it a much more rewarding
				  approach for everyone. In turn this helps to create highly motivated, 
				  high performance teams that are highly co-operative.


			

			Why Blockchain?

				It is a decentralised platform and peer to peer avoiding hacking.
				
				By storing data across its network, the blockchain eliminates the risks that come 
				with data being held centrally.

				Its network lacks centralized points of vulnerability that computer hackers can exploit. 
				Today’s internet has security problems that are familiar to everyone. We all rely on the 
				“username/password” system to protect our identity and assets online. Blockchain security
				methods use encryption technology.

				With Blockchain Users  to the network have private keys and the network stores 
				public keys for encryption/decryption when called upon.
